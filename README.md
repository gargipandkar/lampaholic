SUTD 03.007 Introduction to Design Project (At Play 2.0)


**Project Statement**

Sleep deprivation is detrimental to health and academic performance yet students work long hours into the night. LAMPAHOLIC recognizes the lack of a system which forces students to acknowledge their level of fatigue. Hence, it integrates a feedback mechanism with the desk to detect the userâ€™s fatigue and responds with playful interaction.

Designed to adjust colour temperature and execute gestures like dozing and stretching, LAMPAHOLIC creates a comfortable work environment and encourages an emotional connection with the user. As your smart companion, it intervenes in your vicious work cycle by reminding you to not compromise sleep.
